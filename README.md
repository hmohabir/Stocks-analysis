# Stock Analysis 

VBA Challenge

The client (Steve) 
wants to perform Stock analysis at the click of a button. The initial analysis was for the single stock DAQO, which was then refactored to include all stocks.

Afterwards, the VBA code was further refactored to allow a faster run-time using loops

The document was formatted to allow easy reading 

The client also requested formatting of the document to include "ease of read" features. To accomodate this, conditional formatting was implemented to indicate positve and negative yearly performance.
